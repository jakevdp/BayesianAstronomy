    "1. Define a posterior $p(\\theta~|~D, I)$\n",
    "2. Define a *proposal density* $p(\\theta_{i + 1}~|~\\theta_i)$, which must be a symmetric function, but otherwise is unconstrained (a Gaussian is the usual choice).\n",
    "3. Choose a starting point $\\theta_0$\n",
    "4. Repeat the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Given $\\theta_i$, draw a new $\\theta_{i + 1}$ from the proposal distribution\n",

    "   2. Compute the *acceptance ratio*\n",

    "      $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   3. If $a \\ge 1$, the proposal is more likely: accept the draw and add $\\theta_{i + 1}$ to the chain.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   4. If $a < 1$, then accept the point with probability $a$: this can be done by drawing a uniform random number $r$ and checking if $a < r$. If the point is accepted, add $\\theta_{i + 1}$ to the chain. If not, then add $\\theta_i$ to the chain *again*.\n",
    "   \n",
    "The goal is to produce a \"chain\", i.e. a list of $\\theta$ values, where each $\\theta$ is a vector of parameters for your model.\n",
