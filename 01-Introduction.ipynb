    "- **A frequentist probability is a measure *long-run frequency* of (real or imagined) repeated trials.** Among other things, this generally means that observed data can be described probabilistically (you can repeat the experiment and get a different realization) while model parameters are fixed, and cannot be described probabilistically (the universe remains the same no matter how many times you observe it). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **A Bayesian probability is a *quantification of belief*.** Among other things, this generally means that observed data are treated as fixed (you know exactly what values you measured) while model parameters – including the \"true\" values of the data reflected by noisy measurements – are treated probabilistically (your degree of knowledge about the universe changes as you gather more data).\n",
